* Cool 3d destruction effect in Unity!
My name is Oskar Sigvardsson, and I'm making a cool 3d destruction
effect in Unity. I'm streaming the development over at [[https://www.twitch.tv/chessbiscuit][Twitch]]! Come
hang out in the chat, or just watch the archives.

I wasn't planning on releasing this effect publicly in a repository
this early, but I figure the people on the stream might want to check
it out, so here it is. Keep in mind, this repository is in a VERY
ROUGH shape, not really intended for public consumption. There's all
sorts of nonsense hee, like random meshes, unfinished pieces of code
and unused scenes. The only thing in any kind of shape is the "test"
scene, so open that if you want to check it out. For more details,
check the streams!

Oh, and yeah, here's demo:
